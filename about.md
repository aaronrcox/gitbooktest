## **WELCOME TO ARC LABS**

Hello, I'm Aaron, a Software Engineer, Game Programmer, Web Developer, and Teacher. I**'**m addicted to good beer, good coffee, and good code. 

I currently teach programming courses at The Academy of Interactive Entertainment \(Sydney Australia\). Here I get to introduce people to amazing new technologies and skills as they work toward becoming a game programming master.  
  
During my free time when I'm not ranting about coding standards or naming conventions, I like to tinker with various technologies, new programming languages, old programming languages, web development, game development, you name it, I've probably played with it. Feel free to check out some of my personal projects, or read through some blog posts
