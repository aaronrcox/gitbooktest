**WELCOME TO ARC LABS**  
Hello, I'm Aaron, and I've started to blog. Yep I',m using GitBooks as the platform of choice. I'm hoping this will be a nice online space full of interesting things, technical things, project updates, howto's and various rants.

I Currently work for the Academy of Interactive Entertainment as a Games Programming Teacher / Software developer in Sydney Australia. Here i get a chance to convert normal people into a life of insanity consisting of sleepless nights dreaming of code and that one un unsolved problem that keeps us up at night.

During my free time when i'm not ranting about coding standards or naming conventions, I like to tinker with various technologies, new programming languages, old programming languages, web development, game development, you name it, i've probably played with it.Feel free to check out some of my personal projects, or read through some blog posts

### [Compile and deploy C++ to web with Docker and Github Actions](posts/blog-post-1.md)

In this post, I will show you how I set up a C++ project with CMake and Visual Studio. We will compile to Javascript with Emscripten and Docker. Finally, we will automate the build and deploy with Git
